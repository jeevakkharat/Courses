1) Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming (DP) is a powerful algorithmic technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler, overlapping subproblems and storing the results to avoid redundant computations. It is a method for optimizing recursive solutions, often reducing exponential time complexities to polynomial time.
